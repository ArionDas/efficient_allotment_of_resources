# Efficient Algorithms for Resource Allotment

## Problem
At an instant, let there be q number of requests, i.e., {w1,w2,w3,....,wq} initiated from the respective cluster heads.<br> 
Now, wi can comprise a maximum n types of resources i.e., wi = {r1,r2,r3,....,rn}.<br> 
Let, us assume, there is m number of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), i.e., {u1,u2,u3,....,um} present in our base station with diverse carrying capacities.
<br>
<br>
The problem is to design an algorithm to serve the requested resources to their respective battle clusters using the UAVs, provided the flight time is being minimized.
<br>
<br>
There is a catch though!!<br><br>Every UAV has the capacity to carry different kind of resources. No two UAVs can carry the same type of resources. So, the algorithms have to be optimized enough to address all these constraints.
