# Efficient Algorithms for Resource Allotment

## Problem
At an instant, let there be q number of requests, i.e., {w1,w2,w3,....,wq} initiated from the respective cluster heads.<br> 
Now, wi can comprise a maximum n types of resources i.e., wi = {r1,r2,r3,....,rn}.<br> 
Let, us assume, there is m number of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), i.e., {u1,u2,u3,....,um} present in our base station with diverse carrying capacities.
<br>
<br>
The problem is to design an algorithm to serve the requested resources to their respective battle clusters using the UAVs, provided the flight time is being minimized.
