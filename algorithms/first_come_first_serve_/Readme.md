## First Come First Serve

In this algorithm, the battle cluster which provides it's resource request first, get addressed first.<br><br>
We iterate through all the uavs untill all the resource requested by the battle cluster have been provided.<br><br>
We calculate the time taken by every uav that travels and find out the time taken by every battle cluster, and also print out the maximum time required by a battle cluster.
